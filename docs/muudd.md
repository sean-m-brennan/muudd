## Biblically-aligned networks, or software as God intended

As of this writing, our dominant culture, and thus indeed at least the Anglophone world at large, is in a deep spiritual crisis - a tribulation of unprecedented reach. There is a sense of oppression and disconcertedness that is not yet demonstrable physically, yet is on the cusp of manifesting: "what rough beast, its hour come round at last, Slouches towards" [^1] us? There is a moral void in this age of atomization. Although believers yearn for fellowship, corruption and deceit abound among neighbors and permeate institutions, leading to universal distrust. Entropy has the upper hand.

So war is upon us. Currently just primarily in spirit, but bleeding into the kinetic soon enough, war is always a test of a people's ability to cooperate and coordinate. The Cloud People have their cloud computing: powerful, complex (too complex), tightly interconnected (precariously), centralized and thoroughly monitored. Too monitored. It is quite easy to fall from the cloud with an impure thought. But believers already know: "all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" [^2]. We're already fallen, already in the dirt toiling for a living. All the instruments and tools of ordering our society for the Good have been taken from us (though they stare us in the face). So we need new tools to open lines of communication, to speak the forbidden Truth, to trust again in men of goodwill, and to shun both the traitor and those who curse God.

### God created the World to train the Faithful [^3]

We have a duty to God and to our posterity to resist what is coming - indeed what is already here. But the wicked are in our midst, and as we've already seen they will happily guide us to worldly doom. Amongst us is courage and anger and disgust aplenty, but also an utter inability to organize or even recognize a valid leader. The cypherpunks were right about private communications being an antidote to tyranny, but they largely hold to a different and dying faith - civic humanism. Thus, they failed in their crusade to overthrow an immoral Big Mother government *because* they sought to replace it with amoral chaos. We can take the digital tools with which they were trying to achieve (self-defeating) anarchy and apply them more completely, in ways that build social order instead of further isolating the "sovereign individual".

We know collectivism is bad (observe the 20th century), but so is individualism (vis. the 21st). Neither nation nor citizen are fundamental. We must walk a fine line (narrow path!) between the two as a society. Whether it is implicit or explicit, long-term cooperation and peace requires a shared faith, which creates a synthetic tribe. (Doubtful? How's that multiculturalism working out?) Sharing faith requires the ability to communicate candidly about this world and the next - which we are no longer allowed to do. Christianity is a grassroots faith (the faith, not the religion), sharing the living gospel person-to-person in ongoing interactions. The powers-that-be believe that Christianity is no longer a threat because the various institutions of the religion have been subverted, but the faith itself is yet alive, despite everything. Greater tribulation is coming, however.

What we need is to be able to identify friend and foe, to trust others - not blindly, but tangibly. We need to do this anonymously, at least at first, due to the high social and physical cost of self-revelation. We should also then be able to build new institutions that are both decentralized and founded on strong personal bonds, making then harder to attack externally and internally. All this must not rely on the rather fragile and highly monitored internet or electrical grid.

We already have a blueprint for this social organization from the Old Testament: only a hierarchy of tribal elders, **patriarchy**, can judge a man, because they both know him and have an interest in not just his welfare, but also that of the wider tribe. But Christ brought the sword to cleave kin apart if they disbelieve, and he wields it still. That does not change the optimality of the patriarchal structure though - the tragic caveat being that blood kin are not necessarily spiritual kin.

How do we implement such an order in the age of unlimited immigration, gay rights and feminism? The solution consists of several tiers of organization: hardware, software and human. 

### Hardware

*All* institutions are failing, including those that provide critical infrastructure. Rather than seek to merely patch what exists, we should extend current communications and power networks, while utilizing what exists. 

### Software

### Human


## To Infinity ...

### Space

Why? Because it's there. More importantly, expansion into space provides a new and infinite frontier, an antidote to the current civilizational stagnation we see today. Providing an escape hatch for young men of adventurous spirit - because it's there.

But our current tech is unsustainable, our supply chains tenuous and fragile. Our technology, specifically anything going into space, must be eminently repairable with basic tools and resources through recursive bootstrapping.
